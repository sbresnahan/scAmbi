\title{Plot a Summary of Within-Sample BCV Results}
\usage{
plot_within_sample_summary(within_bcv_results)
}
\arguments{
\item{within_bcv_results}{A nested list of BCV results as returned by
\code{\link{analyze_within_sample_bcv}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object, which is a composite of two plots if both "RNA" and
"RNA_corr" assays are present:
\itemize{
\item A bar plot comparing the median within-sample BCV for each assay
across all samples.
\item A scatter plot directly comparing the median BCV of the "RNA" assay
against the "RNA_corr" assay for each sample.
}
If only one assay is present, only the bar plot is returned. Returns an empty
plot with a message if no valid results are provided.
}
\description{
Creates summary visualizations for within-sample BCV results across multiple
samples and assays.
}
\details{
This function provides a high-level overview of the impact of
overdispersion correction on within-sample variability. The scatter plot is
particularly useful for assessing the consistency of BCV reduction across
different samples.
