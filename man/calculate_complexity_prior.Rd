\title{Calculate complexity-based prior for overdispersion}
\usage{
calculate_complexity_prior(gene_names, gtf_file = NULL, transcript_info = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_names}{Character vector of gene IDs for which to compute the prior.}

\item{gtf_file}{Optional path to a GTF file containing transcript annotations.
If provided and \code{transcript_info} is not given, transcript counts per
gene will be computed from this file.}

\item{transcript_info}{Optional path to a tab-delimited file containing
transcript metadata with a \code{gene_id} column. Used to count transcripts
per gene.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of prior scaling factors (length equal to the number
of genes), where larger values correspond to higher transcript complexity.
}
\description{
Computes a per-gene prior scaling factor for overdispersion estimates
based on transcript complexity, using either a transcript info table
or a GTF annotation file.
}
\details{
For each gene, the number of transcripts is counted, and the prior scaling
factor is computed as:
\deqn{prior = 1 + 0.3 \times \log1p(n\_transcripts - 1)}
Genes absent from the annotation are assigned a prior of 1.0.
