\title{Extract a Named Feature Vector from Seurat Objects}
\usage{
extract_feature_vector(
  seurat_list,
  vector_name,
  prefer_assays = c("RNA_corr", "RNA")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seurat_list}{A list of Seurat objects.}

\item{vector_name}{The character name of the column to extract from the
feature metadata data frame (e.g., "OverDisp_integrated").}

\item{prefer_assays}{A character vector of assay names to search, in order
of preference (e.g., \code{c("RNA_corr", "RNA")}).}
}
\value{
A named numeric or character vector, where names are the feature IDs.
Returns \code{NULL} and a warning if the vector is not found in any of the
specified locations.
}
\description{
Searches through a list of Seurat objects to find and extract a specific
metadata vector from the feature metadata stored in one of the assays.
}
\details{
The function iterates through each object and then through the preferred assays.
It stops and returns the vector as soon as it is found in the first matching
location (\code{object@assays[[assay]]@misc$feature_meta}).
