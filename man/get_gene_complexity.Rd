\title{Calculate Gene Complexity from Transcript Annotations}
\usage{
get_gene_complexity(gtf_file = NULL, transcript_info_file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gtf_file}{Character string; path to a GTF file containing transcript
annotations. This is used if \code{transcript_info_file} is not provided.}

\item{transcript_info_file}{Character string; path to a tab-delimited file
with a \code{gene_id} column. If provided, this file is used in preference to
the GTF file.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector where each element is the number of transcripts
for a gene and the name is the gene ID. Returns \code{NULL} if neither input
file is provided or accessible.
}
\description{
Computes the number of transcripts associated with each gene from a GTF or
a pre-processed transcript information file. This metric can be used to
inform a prior on mapping ambiguity.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# From a pre-processed transcript info file
complexity <- get_gene_complexity(transcript_info_file = "tx_info.tsv")

# From a GTF annotation file
complexity <- get_gene_complexity(gtf_file = "annotation.gtf")
}
