\title{scAmbi: Overdispersion Correction for scRNA-seq Data}
\description{
The \code{scAmbi} package provides a comprehensive toolkit for addressing technical
noise in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, specifically the
overdispersion caused by read-to-transcript mapping ambiguity. This issue is
common in workflows using tools like Salmon/Alevin, which employ bootstrap
replicates to quantify uncertainty.
}
\details{
Key functionalities include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Estimation}: Implements multiple methods to estimate per-gene overdispersion,
including a fast, sparse-aware method for Alevin's bootstrap matrices, a
method-of-moments approach, and a complexity-based prior derived from
transcript annotations (GTF files).
\item \strong{Integration}: Integrates these disparate estimates into a single, robust
overdispersion factor for each transcript using a weighted geometric mean and
empirical Bayes shrinkage.
\item \strong{Correction}: Generates a new, corrected data assay within a Seurat object
where raw counts are adjusted by the bootstrap scaling factors by default.
Vectors for each estimate are also stored for manual correction.
\item \strong{Evaluation}: Offers tools to calculate and visualize the Biological
Coefficient of Variation (BCV) both within a single sample (across pseudo-bulk
replicates) and between different samples. This allows for direct assessment of
how the correction reduces technical variability.
}
The package is designed to integrate smoothly with Seurat-based analysis pipelines.
