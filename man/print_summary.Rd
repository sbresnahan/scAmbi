\title{Print Summary of BCV Analysis Results}
\usage{
print_summary(results, type = "between")
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A list of BCV results.
\itemize{
\item For \code{type = "between"}: each element is a BCV result object
(as from \code{\link{calculate_bcv_direct}}).
\item For \code{type = "within"}: each element is itself a list of
BCV results per sample (as from \code{\link{calculate_within_sample_bcv}}).
}}

\item{type}{Character string indicating whether the results are from a
\code{"between"}-sample analysis or a \code{"within"}-sample analysis.
Defaults to \code{"between"}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Output is printed to the console.
}
\description{
Displays a formatted summary of Biological Coefficient of Variation (BCV)
analysis results for either between-sample or within-sample comparisons.
}
\details{
The summary includes the number of genes, samples, common BCV, median
tagwise BCV, and BCV ranges. If both \code{RNA} and \code{RNA_corr} are
present, it also reports the percent reduction in BCV for \code{RNA_corr}
relative to \code{RNA}.
