\title{Read an EDS matrix with expected dimensions and logging}
\usage{
read_eds_gc(path, n_feat, n_cells, label)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Character string; path to the \code{.eds} file to read.}

\item{n_feat}{Integer; expected number of features (rows) in the matrix.}

\item{n_cells}{Integer; expected number of cells (columns) in the matrix.}

\item{label}{Character string; label used in log messages to identify the dataset.}
}
\value{
A sparse matrix with dimensions \code{n_feat} x \code{n_cells}.
}
\description{
Reads a sparse EDS matrix from disk, checks that its dimensions match the
expected number of features and cells, and logs progress.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
m <- read_eds_gc("counts.eds", n_feat = 20000, n_cells = 5000, label = "Sample1")
}
