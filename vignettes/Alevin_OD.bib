	abstract = {Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq is one of the most commonly performed bioinformatics analyses. Transcript-level quantifications are inherently more uncertain than gene-level read counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence reads to transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned unambiguously to a gene, reads are very often compatible with multiple transcripts for that gene, particularly for genes with many isoforms. Software tools designed for gene-level differential expression do not perform optimally on transcript counts because the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA) disrupts the mean-variance relationship normally observed for gene level RNA-seq data and interferes with the efficiency of the empirical Bayes dispersion estimation procedures. The pseudoaligners kallisto and Salmon provide bootstrap samples from which quantification uncertainty can be assessed. We show that the overdispersion arising from RTA can be elegantly estimated by fitting a quasi-Poisson model to the bootstrap counts for each transcript. The technical overdispersion arising from RTA can then be divided out of the transcript counts, leading to scaled counts that can be input for analysis by established gene-level software tools with full statistical efficiency. Comprehensive simulations and test data show that an edgeR analysis of the scaled counts is more powerful and efficient than previous differential transcript expression pipelines while providing correct control of the false discovery rate. Simulations explore a wide range of scenarios including the effects of paired vs single-end reads, different read lengths and different numbers of replicates.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (dscRNA-seq) data are being generated at an unprecedented pace, and the accurate estimation of gene-level abundances for each cell is a crucial ﬁrst step in most dscRNA-seq analyses. When pre-processing the raw dscRNA-seq data to generate a count matrix, care must be taken to account for the potentially large number of multi-mapping locations per read. The sparsity of dscRNA-seq data, and the strong 3’ sampling bias, makes it difﬁcult to disambiguate cases where there is no uniquely mapping read to any of the candidate target genes.},

Alevin’s approach to UMI deduplication considers transcript-level constraints on the molecules from which UMIs may have arisen and accounts for both gene-unique reads and reads that multimap between genes. This addresses the inherent bias in existing tools which discard gene-ambiguous reads and improves the accuracy of gene abundance estimates. Alevin is considerably faster, typically eight times, than existing gene quantification approaches, while also using less memory.},

	abstract = {The placenta plays a critical role in fetal development and mediates maternal metabolic effects on offspring health outcomes. Despite its importance, the placenta remains understudied in large-scale genomic initiatives, with most analyses focusing on gene-level expression based on annotations from adult tissue references that obscure isoform diversity particularly vital to understanding function in developmental tissues. Here, we employed largest-in-class long-read RNA sequencing (N = 72) to generate a comprehensive placental transcript reference, yielding 37,661 high-confidence isoforms across 12,302 genes. Our assembly revealed 14,985 novel isoforms of known genes and 2,759 transcripts representing previously unannotated genes, with extensive diversity in genes involved in obesity, placental lactogen production, and growth control. We demonstrate this approach has two immediate practical advantages: First, the improved reference reduced inferential uncertainty in isoform quantification by approximately 37\%, reduced the frequency of low-confidence annotations and increased the yield (read depth) of high-confidence annotations. Second, in analyses of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with short-read RNA-seq datasets from two independent, multi-ancestry birth cohorts (N = 344) as an exemplar, we were able to identify novel isoforms of chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1 (CSH1) mediating the effect of maternal hyperglycemia on birth weight that was not apparent in conventional gene-level analyses. These findings demonstrate that isoform-level annotation of placental transcriptomics provides greater sensitivity and specificity than gene-level approaches. This enhanced precision may be essential for understanding placental function in developmental programming of metabolism and reveal ancestry- and context-specific variation in placental function and responses to environmental exposures.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.National Research Foundation, https://ror.org/03cpyc314, OF-LCG; MOH-000504National Medical Research Council, https://ror.org/04x3cxs03, MOH-000550-00, H24P2M0002National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, https://ror.org/0493hgw16, U24MD015970Fonds de recherche du Qu{\'e}bec, https://ror.org/00w3qhf76, 20697Canadian Institutes of Health Research, https://ror.org/01gavpb45, MOP 115071},
